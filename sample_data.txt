LangChain is a powerful framework designed for building applications that leverage large language models (LLMs) to interact with data, perform computations, and create context-aware experiences. It has gained immense popularity for its modular and composable approach, which allows developers to build sophisticated AI-driven applications by combining multiple components like prompt engineering, document retrieval, and external integrations. LangChain simplifies the complexity of working with LLMs by providing a structured way to manage data flow, integrate external tools, and handle complex workflows.

At its core, LangChain is built around the concept of chains, which represent sequences of steps where each step uses the output of the previous one. Chains can range from simple, single-step processes (e.g., answering a question) to highly complex, multi-step workflows involving data retrieval, computation, and conditional logic. The modularity of chains allows developers to easily customize and extend their functionality, making LangChain highly adaptable to a variety of use cases, from chatbots and virtual assistants to document summarization and decision-making systems.
